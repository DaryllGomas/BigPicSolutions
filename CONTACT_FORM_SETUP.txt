# ⚡ Quick Contact Form Setup

Just **ONE THING** to make your contact form work:

## 1. Replace Email in index.html

Open `index.html` and find this line (around line 875):
```html
<form class="contact-form" action="https://formsubmit.co/YOUR_EMAIL_HERE" method="POST">
```

Change `YOUR_EMAIL_HERE` to your actual email address. For example:
```html
<form class="contact-form" action="https://formsubmit.co/john@bigpicsolutions.com" method="POST">
```

## 2. That's it! 

- Push your changes to GitHub
- Visit your site
- Submit the form once to activate (FormSubmit will email you)
- Click their activation link
- Done! ✅

Your contact form will now send emails directly to you, with a nice thank you page after submission.
