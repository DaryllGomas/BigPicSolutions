# Assets Directory

This directory contains all static assets for the Big Pic Solutions website.

## Structure

```
assets/
└── images/
    └── AppleCert.png    # Apple Certified Support Professional badge
```

## Usage

All static assets should be organized in appropriate subdirectories:
- `images/` - All image files (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
- `css/` - External stylesheets (if separated from HTML)
- `js/` - External JavaScript files (if separated from HTML)
- `fonts/` - Custom web fonts (if needed)

## Adding New Assets

When adding new assets:
1. Place them in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Optimize images for web (compress, appropriate dimensions)
4. Update references in HTML/CSS/JS files
5. Document any new assets in this README

## Image Optimization Tips

- Use PNG for images with transparency
- Use JPG for photographs
- Keep file sizes as small as possible
- Consider using modern formats like WebP for better compression
